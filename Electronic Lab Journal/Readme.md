<h1> Electronic Lab Journal Guide </h1>

An Electronic Lab Journal is a digital version that replicates an interface much like a page in your paper lab notebook. In your ELN you can enter protocols, observations, other data just like you would do on paper. ELNs offer several advantages over traditional paper notebooks; they facilitate good data management practices, providing for data security, auditing, and collaboration.

<h2> The advantages of an Electronic Lab Journal </h2>
This guide consists of different sections: information, Table of Contents, and two project examples. <br>
Properly organizing data of your project, by the use of ELN and RDM, has many advantages:
<ul>
  <li>You or others will be able to easily find your data</li>
  <li>You or others will be able to reuse your data, to continue the project etc</li>
  <li>Data, like journal articles and books, is a scholarly product</li>
</ul>
<br>
Good management helps to prevent errors and increases the quality of your analyses!

<h2> Which Electronic Lab Notebook to pick?</h2>
